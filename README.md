**Employee Data Analysis using Python**


Welcome to our employee data analysis project! This repository holds a Python script designed to help you dive into your employee data using the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries. The script reads data from a CSV file, conducts different types of analyses, and creates visual representations. Our analysis covers important aspects like team distribution, employee roles, age groups, salary allocation, and the potential connection between age and salary.

Key Features and Highlights
1. **Getting Data Ready:** The script begins by reading employee details from a CSV file and takes care of cleaning the data. It addresses missing values, adds random height values, and organizes the data for meaningful analysis.

2. **Understanding Teams:** We delve into the distribution of employees across different teams. The script calculates the count and percentage of employees in each team, then presents this information in an easy-to-understand DataFrame with team names, employee counts, and percentage breakdowns.

3. **Roles and Positions:** We break down employee roles further by counting how many employees are in each position (SG, PF, PG, SF, C). This gives insights into how different roles are represented within the organization.

4. **Age Insights:** The script categorizes employees into specific age groups, providing an overview of the age distribution. We identify the age group with the most employees and display this information prominently.

5. **Spending Wisely:** Identifying the team and role with the highest salary allocation is crucial. Our script calculates and showcases the team and position where the organization invests the most in terms of salaries.

6. **Age-Salary Relationship:** We visualize the potential connection between employee age and their salaries through scatter plots. This graphical representation helps to quickly understand if there's any pattern between these two variables.

How to Use
1. **Getting Started:** Clone this repository to your computer.
2. **Software Requirements:** Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) installed.
3. **Your Data:** Replace the CSV file path in the script with your own employee data file's path.
4. **Running the Script:** Use a Python interpreter to run the script.
5. **Insights and Visuals:** Explore the insights and visualizations in the console and any graphs generated.
6. **Adapt to Your Needs:** Feel free to tweak the script to suit your specific data and requirements.
